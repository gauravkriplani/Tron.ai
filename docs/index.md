Tron is an arcade-style light-cycle game where players race on a grid leaving impassable trails; the last player to avoid collisions wins. Its fast-paced, spatial, and adversarial dynamics make it a compact but challenging testbed for reinforcement learning, requiring both immediate reflexes and longer-term planning. Our project trains and evaluates RL agents (value-based and policy-based) on Tron using grid or pixel observations, comparing architectures and metrics to identify which approaches work best.
